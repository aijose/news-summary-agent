## Phase 3: Advanced Features (DESCOPED)

**Status**: ‚ùå Removed from scope on 2025-09-30

**Rationale**: After completing Phase 2, determined that core features (search, summarization, multi-perspective analysis) provide sufficient value for the use case. Advanced features would add complexity without proportional benefit.

**Descoped Features**:
- Timeline creation and event tracking
- Impact analysis engine (economic, political, social)
- Source credibility scoring system
- Proactive alert and notification system

**Decision**: Focus resources on production readiness, testing, and deployment instead.

## Production Readiness Phase (Current Focus)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Frontend code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Bundle size optimization (<500KB gzipped)
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] API response caching improvements
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for critical backend services
- [ ] Frontend component tests with React Testing Library
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Test coverage target: >70%

### Deployment
- [ ] Production environment configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Monitoring and error tracking (Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

### Documentation
- [ ] User guide with screenshots
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Development setup guide
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Architecture documentation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] <3 second initial page load
- [ ] All critical features tested
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks & Mitigation

**High Priority Risks:**
1. **LLM API Costs**: Implement usage monitoring, prompt optimization
2. **ChromaDB Performance**: Monitor query times, implement caching
3. **Data Quality**: Add validation, source diversity requirements

**Medium Priority Risks:**
1. **RSS Feed Reliability**: Multiple source redundancy
2. **Frontend Performance**: Progressive loading, optimization
3. **Database Scaling**: Connection pooling, query optimization

### Contingency Plans

**Week 1-2 Delays**: Reduce initial RSS sources, simplify CLI
**Week 3-4 Delays**: Use component library, defer advanced UI features
**Week 5-8 Delays**: Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-have analytics
**Week 9-12 Delays**: Manual deployment, defer optimization features

## Resource Requirements - UPDATED

### Development Time (Actual)
- **Phase 1**: ~40 hours (backend infrastructure + MVP)
- **Phase 2**: ~40 hours (frontend + TanStack Query integration)
- **Production**: ~40 hours estimated (testing + deployment + docs)
- **Total**: ~120 hours (vs originally planned 240 hours)
- **Savings**: ~120 hours from descoping Phase 3

### External Dependencies
- **Claude API**: Usage-based pricing, monitor costs
- **News Sources**: Free RSS feeds, backup sources ready
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Minimal for personal project
- **Development Tools**: Mostly free/open source

## Implementation Strategy

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Week 2**: Backend testing while starting frontend setup
- **Week 4**: Frontend polish while implementing backend analytics
- **Week 6**: Advanced features while beginning optimization
- **Week 10**: Deployment setup while finalizing features

### Quality Gates
- **Phase 1**: All MVP features functional, tests passing
- **Phase 2**: Frontend responsive, multi-perspective working
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features operational, performance acceptable
- **Phase 4**: Production deployment successful, documentation complete

### Monitoring and Adjustment
- **Weekly Reviews**: Progress against timeline, risk assessment
- **Feature Validation**: User feedback (personal use), performance metrics
- **Quality Checkpoints**: Code review, testing, documentation
- **Scope Management**: Feature prioritization, technical debt balance

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1, Day 1)
1. Create backend/ and frontend/ project directories
2. Set up Docker Compose with PostgreSQL
3. Initialize uv environment and install core dependencies
4. Begin database schema design
5. Start RSS feed research and configuration

### Success Criteria for Week 1

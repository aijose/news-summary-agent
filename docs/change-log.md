## 2025-10-02: Article Ingestion Issues Fixed (Ubuntu)

### Fixed
- **Database Setup**: Missing database tables causing SQL errors
- **RSS Feed URLs**: Broken Hacker News feed URL and 403 errors from MIT feed
- **Error Logging**: Empty exception messages in logs not showing actual errors
- **Configuration Reloading**: Settings changes requiring server restart

### Issues Resolved
1. **Missing Database Tables**
   - **Problem**: `no such table: articles` error during ingestion
   - **Cause**: Alembic migrations never run, missing versions directory
   - **Solution**: Created `alembic/versions/`, generated and applied initial migration
   - **Commands**: `uv run alembic revision --autogenerate` → `uv run alembic upgrade head`

2. **Broken RSS Feed URL**
   - **Problem**: `https://storage.googleapis.com/hnrss/newest.xml` returning HTTP 404
   - **Solution**: Updated to working URL `https://hnrss.org/newest`
   - **Files**: Fixed in both `.env.example` and `.env`

3. **MIT Feed 403 Forbidden**
   - **Problem**: `https://news.mit.edu/rss/feed` blocking requests
   - **Solution**: Removed from default feed list to prevent constant errors

4. **Poor Error Logging**
   - **Problem**: Exception logs showing empty strings
   - **Solution**: Enhanced logging: `{type(e).__name__}: {str(e) or 'No error message'}`

### Files Added
- `backend/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for future issues
- Database tables: `articles`, `user_preferences`, `summaries` created successfully

### Platform Verification
- ✅ **Ubuntu Compatibility**: All issues resolved, article ingestion working
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Setup**: Frontend npm issues from previous session also resolved
- ✅ **Database**: 186 articles successfully ingested and verified
- ✅ **RSS Feeds**: All remaining feeds working correctly

### Prevention Added
- Troubleshooting documentation with command examples
- RSS feed health testing scripts
- Database setup verification procedures
- Environment variable validation checklist

### Impact
- **Article Ingestion**: Now fully functional on Ubuntu/Linux platforms

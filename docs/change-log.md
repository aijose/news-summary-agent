## 2025-09-27: Package Management Update

### Changed
- **Python Package Management**: Switched from Poetry to uv
- **Development Workflow**: Updated installation and dependency management commands
- **Documentation**: Updated all references to Poetry with uv usage

### Rationale
- **Performance**: uv is 10-100x faster than Poetry for installations and dependency resolution
- **Simplicity**: Single tool for package management and virtual environments
- **Modern Design**: Built with Rust for speed and reliability
- **Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for pip with better dependency resolution

### Files Updated
- `README.md`: Updated prerequisites and quick start commands
- `docs/tech-stack.md`: Added uv decision rationale and updated architecture decisions
- `docs/project-status.md`: Updated development tools and key decisions
- `docs/decision-log.md`: Added formal decision log entry for uv adoption
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated tech stack reference

### Impact
- **Development Setup**: Future development will use `uv venv` and `uv pip install` commands
- **Performance**: Faster dependency resolution and installation during development
- **Simplicity**: Reduced complexity in package management workflow
